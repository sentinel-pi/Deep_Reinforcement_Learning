# ðŸ§  Deep Reinforcement Learning Collection
Welcome to my Deep Reinforcement Learning Collection -
i try to put the prominent Reinforcemnt learning Algorithms here according to research papers.
the goal of this collection is to be a solid starting point for hobbiest and researchers to implement and add functionality to their code. 
a youtube video course relate to that will produced in the future 


## ðŸ§ª Algorithms Implemented
- [**Value Based DRL**](./ValueBased/)
    - âœ… Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
    - âœ… Double DQN
    - âœ… Dueling DQN
    - âœ… Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)
    - âœ… Noisy DQN
    - âœ… N-step DQN 
    - ðŸ”„ c51
    - ðŸ”„ rainbow
- **Value Based DRL**
    - coming soon...
